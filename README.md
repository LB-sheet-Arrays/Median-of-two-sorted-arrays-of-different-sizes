# Median-of-two-sorted-arrays-of-different-sizes

Question >>

Given two sorted arrays, a[] and b[], the task is to find the median of these sorted arrays, in O(log n + log m) time complexity, 
when n is the number of elements in the first array, and m is the number of elements in the second array.
This is an extension of median of two sorted arrays of equal size problem. Here we handle arrays of unequal size also.

Input: ar1[] = {-5, 3, 6, 12, 15}
        ar2[] = {-12, -10, -6, -3, 4, 10}
Output : The median is 3.
Explanation : The merged array is :
        ar3[] = {-12, -10, -6, -5 , -3,
                 3, 4, 6, 10, 12, 15},
       So the median of the merged array is 3

Input: ar1[] = {2, 3, 5, 8}
        ar2[] = {10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20}
Output : The median is 11.
Explanation : The merged array is :
        ar3[] = {2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20}
        if the number of the elements are even, 
        so there are two middle elements,
        take the average between the two :
        (10 + 12) / 2 = 11.
